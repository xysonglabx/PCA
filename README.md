# PCA
We've made some changes to the original author's code to fit our trajectory plotting.
The modified program is the same as the source program, and we have attached the installation guide of the source program.
Now the code can draw a 3D PCA image like this

We have uploaded the corresponding trace files in the XTC files folder, please download all the zip files if needed.
If you need it and we keep the code before the change, please replace the write_plot00.py with the write_plot.py in the lib folder.
